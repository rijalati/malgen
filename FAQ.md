Frequently Asked Questions

## I just want to generate a single data file to test my malstone implementation ##

You can use any data file generated by a malgen run, but if you take a single file out of many, it will not be statistically valid.  You can generate a single file that follows the distribution by running:

> `python malgen.py -O <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY> -o <FILE_NAME> 0 <NUMBER_RECORDS> 0 0`

## Do I really need to generate multiple blocks per node? ##

No.  Older versions of the code was much more memory-intensive and it was painful to generate larger ( > 100 million records) files on each node.  This is no longer the case and we usually generate 500 million record files per node.

There is actually no benefit in running multiple smaller blocks per node and when the file concatenation is considered, it could take longer.

We left the block option for people using older machines with less RAM.
